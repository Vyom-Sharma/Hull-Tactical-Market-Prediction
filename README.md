# Hull-Tactical-Market-Prediction

This notebook implements a full machine-learning pipeline for the Hull Tactical Kaggle Competition, where the goal is to predict S&P 500 daily excess returns and convert predictions into portfolio allocations in the range 0–2× leverage.
The project challenges the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) by systematically searching for weak predictive signals in ~35 years of noisy market data.
